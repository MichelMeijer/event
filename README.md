> **Note:** This repository is part of [Dazzle Project](https://github.com/dazzle-php/dazzle) - the next-gen library for PHP. The project's purpose is to provide PHP developers with a set of complete tools to build functional async applications. Please, make sure you read the attached README carefully and it is guaranteed you will be surprised how easy to use and powerful it is. In the meantime, you might want to check out the rest of our async libraries in [Dazzle repository](https://github.com/dazzle-php) for the full extent of Dazzle experience.

## Description

Dazzle Event is a library which purpose is to provide all of the tools that are required to implement event-based architecture in any application. It delivers classes and interfaces designed specifically for that exact purpose and is designed to be easy to work with, efficient and effective.

## Feature Highlights

Dazzle Event features:

* Support for working with events, event-dispatchers and event-handlers,
* Support for synchronous events,
* Support for asynchronous events using loop,
* Built-in event handlers,
* Built-in expanded interfaces for attaching listeners and managing events propagation,
* ...and more.

## Provided Example(s)

### Quickstart

```php
use Dazzle\Event\EventEmitter;

$emitter = new EventEmitter();

$emitter->on('script.start', function($user, $time) {
    echo "User '$user' has started this script at $time.\n";
});

$emitter->emit('script.start', [ get_current_user(), date('H:i:s Y-m-d') ]);
```

## Requirements

Dazzle Event requires:

* PHP-5.6 or PHP-7.0+,
* UNIX or Windows OS.

## Installation

To install this library make sure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed, then run following command:

```
$> composer require dazzle-php/event
```

## Tests

Tests can be run via:

```
$> vendor/bin/phpunit -d memory_limit=1024M
```

## Versioning

Versioning of Dazzle libraries is being shared between all packages included in [Dazzle Project](https://github.com/dazzle-php/dazzle). That means the releases are being made concurrently for all of them. On one hand this might lead to "empty" releases for some packages at times, but don't worry. In the end it is far much easier for contributors to maintain and -- what's the most important -- much more straight-forward for users to understand the compatibility and inter-operability of the packages.
